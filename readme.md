While this project is intended for practice making API calls, the hope is that inquiring minds go digging to see what is going on under the hood. In this Express API are many concepts that will likely not yet be covered yet at this point including TypeScript, Node, Express, Object Oriented Programming, SQLite, and a few others. Ideally, when these concepts are covered in class, this project can also serve as a reference so you can see these topics in action!

NOTE! Most developers would consider this project to be "overly commented". This has been done due to the educational nature of the project. Usually, there is not a need to comment on what every line of code. Consider this a "do as I say, not as I do" moment.
